# About

I am presently working at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as a Robotics Systems Engineer](https://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/robert-swan/). I received my Master's of Science degree in Computer Science: Intelligent Robotics at the University of Southern California in 2021 where I worked for the [USC Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/) while also interning at the [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I am primarily interested in how autonomous robots can be used to solve problems for those with the greatest needs and to teach future scientists & engineers. To that end, I have devoted myself to learning about and gaining experience with all of the underlying technologies, specifically from a integration, control and artificial intelligence perspective.

## NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)

For the moment I am working on a lunar rover concept, mixed reality robot control, and a prospective open source motion planning library. Previously I worked on a snake robot called [EELS](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/robotics-at-jpl/eels), nighttime global localization with [ShadowNav](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04630), and high-speed off-road autonomy integration for [RACER](https://spectrum.ieee.org/darpa-robot-racer).

### Past Work

I helped to develop a photorealistic Lunar simulation in Blender in order to aid research projects which are investigating high speed rover nighttime navigation on the moon, especially around [permanently shadowed regions (PSRs)](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/979).

I developed and deployed [semantic image segmentation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/AI4Space/papers/Swan_AI4MARS_A_Dataset_for_Terrain-Aware_Autonomous_Driving_on_Mars_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf) and rover energy estimation technology which may one day allow us to [deploy high speed fully autonomous rovers to Mars and other extraterrestrial bodies](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/machine-learning-based-analytics-for-autonomous-rover-systems-maars/). This work is well summarized in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/mbUENWq0Aj0). Autonomous exploration is important due to the latency between human controllers and rovers when they are on separate planets. 

## Interaction Lab

At the interaction lab I worked to develop a robotic system to enable human robot interaction (HRI) research. This took the form of a [robot operating system (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) stack called [HARMONI](https://github.com/interaction-lab/HARMONI) which we structured to make it easy to add new robots (robot agnostic) and create new interactions for research.

# Publications

I have published a number of papers in the past few years; the full list can [be found here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vpgYrcsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

# Side-Projects

I was most recently involved with [USC Makers](https://viterbimakers.usc.edu/) where I led a team to [build a robot to pass butter](https://youtu.be/KnfKHjKCb0k). Joining Makers was one of my better decisions while attending USC. The club has been able to nurture a thriving makers community despite the nature of COVID and remote work. I had a lot of fun with this group and still talk to the members from time to time.
